--------------------------------------

A decision support system (DSS) is an information system that provides statistical assistance to the decision making process of a company or an organization. Decision support systems help people make informed decisions about problems that can change quickly and are not easily defined in advance, i.e., unstructured and semi-structured decision problems, and are designed for the executive, operational, and planning levels of an organization . Decision support systems can be either fully computer-based, human-controlled, or a combination of both.
